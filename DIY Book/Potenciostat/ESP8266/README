# Code aplication for Potenciostat reading in ESP8266 based microcontroller
This code is an example of usage for potenciostat in a microcontroller based in ESP8266; it is not a library yet.
It contains certain functions created to select parameters for reading cycle as setting speed cycle or setting number of cycles per reading. Every function is commented for its correct usage.

## Additional requirements
This code needs the aplication of EspSoftwareSerial library from https://github.com/plerup/espsoftwareserial/ as potenciostat uses UART serial protocol for its communication.
