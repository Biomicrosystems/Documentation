        <p class="class=h6-titlle">Environmental monitoring is an area that comprises gas detection (e.g. O2, COx, SOx)
            and waste monitoring (e.g. biomass, biogas production). Our team developes sensors and biosensors for these
            purposes using MOx (Metal-Oxide), IR (Infrared), polymeric nanolayers, surface functionalization and
            microsystem fabrication technologies.

            In addition, we develop specific electronics to incorporate there sensors into field-equipment.

            <span> <strong>Gas Sensors</strong>
                <br>Development of gas microsensor using MOx (Metal-Oxide), surface functionalization and polymeric
                nanolayers is one of our main components in these area. However, our technology is not limitated by
                those techniques. IR (Infrared) technology is a promising technology in the detection and quantification
                of gases. Until now, we have developed several gas sensors using multiple technologies, our brochure
                includes oxygen, COx, H2S and SOx gases.</span>

            <span> <strong>Micro-respirometer</strong>
                <br>We develope new equipment and technology for in-situ measurements of biomass in waste treatment
                plants and farms. Our system is capable of establishing the biomass of a real sample in a matter of 90
                minutes without the need of labs or experts. The complete equipment measures the biomass of different
                samples and gives the detailes information in electronic format so it can be downloaded using a USB
                port. The measuring device is a low cost (<$5 USD) disposable element while the reading equipment is
                    fully portable.</span>

                    <span> <strong>Bioreactors</strong>
                        <br>Using the microfabrication technology, we can produce different and configurable bioreactors
                        on glass or transparent polymers to grow bacteria, yeast, fungi or algea. Our technology has
                        been tested for several strains and can be complemented with passive microelectronics to detect
                        variations of the cultures.</span>
